# sudokunet
A small project to play around with Razor. This app implements a sudoku generator service, and outputs both a minimal sudoku and it's solution.

Because a primitive algorithm is used to find the minimal sudoku, they tend to be on the easier side.

## setup
make sure `dotnet` is installed. Then, simply
```
dotnet run
```
